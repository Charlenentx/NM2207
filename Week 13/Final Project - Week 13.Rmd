### **Week 9**

1)  The topic that I have chosen for this project will be "Inflation".
    For this project, I will be investigating inflation rates worldwide
    and most importantly Singapore, analysing its global trends and the
    factors contributing to its rise or fall.

2)  The data sources that I have curated so far are Inflation data by
    International Monetary Fund and Core Inflation of Singapore by
    Monetary Authority of Singapore.

### **Week 10**

1)  Why is inflation happening in Singapore?

2)  

-   According to Monetary Authority Singapore, inflation affects many
    areas of the economy hence there is a need to understand inflation
    to secure a low and stable inflation in the Singapore economy over
    time.
-   Singapore has the second highest inflation rate in 2023 among the
    ASEAN 5 countries according to the data provided by International
    Monetary Fund.
-   Inflation in Singapore has been persistently growing according to
    data from Monetary Authority Singapore.

3)  For the dataset "Inflation_world", I will be using the columns of
    'region' and 'Inflation_rate'.

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("Inflation_world.csv")
```

For the dataset "ASEAN_5_IMF", I will be using the columns of 'Year',
'Inflation_rate' and 'Country'.

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}

read_csv("Asean_5_IMF.csv")
```

For the dataset "weights_goods", I will be using the columns of
'Weights' and 'Goods'.

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}

read_csv("weights_goods_singstat.csv")

```

For the dataset "CPI_goods", I will be using the columns of 'Goods' and
'Weights'.

```{r, eval=T,echo=FALSE}
read_csv("CPI_goods_singstat.csv")

```

One challenge I faced was to clean and format the dataset such that R
can read my data. For example, in the dataset "ASEAN_5_IMF", 'country'
and 'year' were initally in rows instead of columns and hence R was not
able to read and produce the result that I want. It took me a very long
time trying to figure out the problem and find the best way to edit the
Excel to get the end result. Another challenge I faced was to think of
the question that I want to answer. The question cannot be too broad or
too narrow as it will affect the rest of my data story. Therefore, to
think of one, I need to exercise forward thinking and plan how the rest
of my project will turn out so that I can achieve an organised data
story that make sense.

### **Week 11**

Question 1:

1)  Choropleth Map (Inflation Rate of every country) - To illustrate
    that inflation rate is a worldwide issue and hence shows the
    importance for inflation to be tackled.
2)  Multiple Line graph to compare the trend between the ASEAN 5
    countries (X: Year, Y: Inflation Rate) - To show how Singapore has
    the second highest inflation rate in 2023 among the ASEAN 5
    countries
3)  Pie Chart (Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) Weights of each goods or
    service) - To show the relative importance of each good or service
    in the basket.
4)  Multiple Line graph to compare the trend of CPI between the
    different type of goods in Singapore (X: Year, Y: CPI) - Compare the
    average price changes of a goods and services over time and
    determine which goods or services fluctuate the most.

Question 2:

1.  Choropleth Map: Shiny & Leaflet

-   A world map that shows and compare the inflation rates of every
    country using different degree of colors. User is allowed to zoom in
    and out of the map

2.  Multiple Line graph: Shiny

-   Select input menu that allow users to choose the countries that they
    want to plot.
-   Slider to allow the user to choose the year interval

3.  Pie Chart: Shiny

-   Slider to allow the user to choose the year that they want to
    visualise

4.  Multiple Line graph: Shiny

-   Select input menu that allow users to choose the type of goods that
    they want to plot.
-   Slider to allow the user to choose the year interval

Question 3:

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}


library(tibble)
tribble(
  ~Concepts, ~Week,  
  "Choropleth map", "NA",   
  "Slider", "8" , 
  "Select input menu", "NA",
  "Line graph", "NA",
  "Pie-chart", "NA" 
)

```

Challenges:

As I was planning on how my datasets can come together to form a data
story, I realised that it is very difficult to answer the question that
i have set last week as my datasets are too specific for that question.
Hence, I have decided to change my question to: Which types of goods and
services will make the most significant impact on households during
inflation?

When I was considering how interactive I want my data to be, I found it
challenging to envision the ideal format for my data visualisations.
Striking the right balance was difficult, as it cannot be too simple and
at the same time too complex for me to code. In light of this situation,
I decided to explore various data visualisations and interactive options
available on the internet. Eventually, I identified the most suitable
ones that aligned with my specific needs and preferences.

### **Week 12**

The main challenge that I faced this week was when I made modifications
to my Shiny app and attempted to re-publish it, an error unexpectedly
occurred. Despite multiple attempts, both on my own and with the
assistance of TAs, the cause of the problem became clear only after some
time. It was determined that the error was due to my wrong placement of
the data files, rendering them undetectable by Shiny.

### **Final Submission**

1.  **Theme**: Inflation

    **Question**: Which types of goods and services will make the most
    significant impact on households during inflation in Singapore?

2.  **Importance of addressing inflation**

Inflation has emerged as a worldwide issue ever since the pandemic and
the Russia-Ukraine war which has caused supply chain disruptions.

In December of the previous year, Singapore secured the top spot as the
most expensive city in the world (Economist Intelligence Unit, 2022).
Headline inflation also surged by 3.8% from 2021, reaching 6.1% in 2022
(Department of Statistics Singapore, 2022).

Inflation has led to a decline in the purchasing power of families,
particularly impacting the standards of living for low-income families
who are facing difficulty in meeting basic living expenses, thereby
exerting adverse effects on their mental and physical well-being.
Therefore, it is important to identify the specific goods or services
that will make a huge impact on households in Singapore, so that
policymakers can formulate targeted solutions and strategies, aiming to
rectify the issue and restore inflation rates to more sustainable
levels.

(3) **How does the datasets answer my question**

The Global inflation data illustrates the different inflation rates
across countries, emphasising the widespread nature of the issue that
has to be tackled.

The ASEAN-5 dataset compares the inflation rates of the 5 countries over
time. This is to illustrate the approximate time frame that led to the
most recent inflation spike as well as to determine the position of
Singapore's inflation rate as compared to its neighbouring countries.

The CPI (Consumer Price Index) data measures the average price changes
in a fixed basket of goods and services commonly purchased by households
over time. From this data, we will be able to pinpoint the specific
goods and services that have experienced notable price hikes.

The CPI weights data, derived from the Household Expenditure Survey,
offer insights into the consumption patterns of households. The CPI
weights indicate the relative importance of each item, averaged for all
households, providing a comprehensive understanding of the goods and
services most significantly impacted by rising prices.

By analysing the CPI data and weights data, we can pinpoint the goods
and services households spend the most on and have recently undergone
substantial price increases. This allows us to identify the specific
items that will have the most significant impact on households during
inflation in Singapore.

(4) **Insights and depiction of data**

The Choropleth map above provides a visual representation of global
inflation rates using colors to depict varying levels. A majority of the
countries have an average inflation rate falling within the 5-10% range,
reiterating the widespread nature of the issue that needs to be tackled.

The line graph illustrates a comparison of inflation rates among the
ASEAN-5 countries. All countries experienced a surge in their inflation
starting from 2020. In 2023, Singapore is placed 2nd among the ASEAN
nations.

This line graph depicts a comparison of CPI among the goods and
services. Within this category, Transport experienced the most
significant surge in prices, followed by Food excluding food serving
services and Food serving services.

The pie chart represents the distribution of household expenditures on
various goods and services. It illustrates the relative importance of
each goods and service. Housing utilities emerged as the highest ranked
followed by transport and Food serving services. Private transport and
Hawker food emerged as the highest expenditure among the sub-categories
for Transport and Food Serving Services respectively.

Based on all the data given, we can justify that Transport and Food
serving services will make the most significant impact on households
during inflation as both are ranked one of the highest in terms of CPI
and household expenditures.

This is further proven as global economies reopened after the Covid-19
pandemic, demand rebounded strongly as consumers were eager to make
purchases they had deferred during the pandemic, causing demand-pull
inflation. However, supply could not match the rapid demand surge due to
lingering restrictions that caused a shortage in supply. Hence, leading
to the rise in prices of global food and energy commodities, when demand
is more than supply. Additionally, the conflict between Russia and
Ukraine war disrupted the global supply, even contributing to cost-pull
inflation. The higher energy and food prices drove up electricity,
transport and import costs for consumers and businesses globally,
including Singapore (Monetary Authority of Singapore, 2023)

(5) **Implementation and New Concepts**

Firstly, I started by researching the topics that I was interested in.
Given my current major in Economics, I choose to focus on Inflation, a
subject familiar to me so that I can leverage my existing knowledge and
ensure a deeper understanding of the concepts involved.

Once the topic was determined, I gathered relevant datasets for my data
story, ultimately selecting four datasets. The first 2, Global Inflation
data and ASEAN5 data are used to illustrate the importance of addressing
my chosen topic. The latter 2, CPI and CPI weights, are used to address
my question.

For the Global Inflation data, I aimed to create a choropleth map
illustrating the diverse inflation rates worldwide through different
degrees of colours. To achieve this, I incorporated Leaflet to Shiny, a
whole new concept for me. The process of figuring out the codes was
challenging, but ultimately rewarding as I successfully implemented the
visualisation.

Moving on to the ASEAN-5 and CPI datasets, both involved the plotting of
line graphs to compare inflation trends among countries and goods and
services. To enhance user interaction, I integrated slider functionality
in Shiny, allowing users to select their desired periods for comparison.
Additionally, the Select Input function enabled users to choose specific
countries, goods, and services, introducing another aspect that was
previously unfamiliar to me.

I also incorporated a drill-down pie chart for the CPI weights data. The
pie chart displays the CPI weights broken by the main categories. User
can further click into each category to read data of their respective
sub-categories to understand what the main categories consist of.
Additionally, a "Back button" is included to allow users to move back to
the main data by clicking the button.

To enhance the overall aesthetics and user experience of the website, I
integrated the card function, layout_sidebar and bslib package in Shiny.
These features enabled users to easily access the interactive features
that they can control, contributing to a more organised and visually
appealing presentation of the data on my webpage.
