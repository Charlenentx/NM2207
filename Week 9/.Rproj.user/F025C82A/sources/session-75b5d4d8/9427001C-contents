**Week 9**

1) The topic that I have chosen for this project will be "Inflation". For this project, I will be investigating inflation rates worldwide and most importantly Singapore, analysing its global trends and the factors contributing to its rise or fall.

2) The data sources that I have curated so far are Inflation data by International Monetary Fund and Core Inflation of Singapore by Monetary Authority of Singapore.
